<!-- 4-paragraph of text about erica bottom 3rd of page spanning near entire width of page -->
    <p class="summary"> Erica Peterson is a nationally-recognized environmental journalist living in Louisville, Ky. Her work can be heard on public radio stations in Louisville and throughout the region, as well as nationally.<br><br>

Appalachia is a region that has long-struggled with environmental issues--from the effects of mining and burning coal to the legacy of now-defunct industrial sites--and Erica's coverage plays an essential role in informing listeners about the complicated relationship between energy and development decisions and the natural world.<br><br>
       

Her stories focus on the federal, state and local energy policy decisions that affect Kentuckians, as well as the environmental consequences.<br><br><br><br>
