    <p class="about"> I grew up in New Jersey and went to school in Minnesota and Chicago, but became a reporter in Appalachia. After grad school, I moved to Charleston, West Virgina to work as a general assignment reporter for the state's public radio affiliate. There, I gravitated toward issues involving energy and the environment; both rich and complex topics in the state.<br><br>

In 2011, I moved to Louisville to report solely on energy and the environment for WFPL, the state's largest public radio station. Here, my work has run the gamut from reporting on coal-fired power plants to stories about invasive species and biodiversity to extensive coverage of proposed natural gas liquids pipelines. These are radio stories, but are often highly-technical and include investigative and data components, too.<br><br> 

My work has also aired on NPR's Morning Edition, All Things Considered, Weekend Edition and Here & Now, as well as other public radio shows like Living on Earth and Only a Game.<br><br>

My reporting has been recognized with local, statewide and national awards and fellowships.  In 2012, I was awarded a National Health Journalism fellowship from the California Endowment to report on the health effects of industrial pollution in Louisville.  In 2014, I won a Sigma Delta Chi award from the Society of Professional Journalists for stories I did chronicling my attempts to monitor for black carbon pollution in the city. In 2015, the Heinrich Boell Foundation funded a reporting trip to Germany for a series on pertinent lessons for Kentucky from Germany's energy transition.<br><br>

I live in Louisville with my husband and son. <br><br>
